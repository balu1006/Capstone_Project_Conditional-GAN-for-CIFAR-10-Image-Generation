# **Conditional GAN for CIFAR-10 Image Generation**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a part of the **Generative Models for Developers** course at Infosys, where the primary objective is to build and train a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)**. The CGAN is trained to generate synthetic images that resemble images from the CIFAR-10 dataset based on specified class labels.

## **Project Motivation**

Generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have emerged as a powerful tool in deep learning for generating realistic data. This project focuses on the application of CGANs, which are a variant of GANs that generate images conditioned on specific labels. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where class-specific data generation is required, such as data augmentation, synthetic data generation, and creative AI.

## **Key Features**

- **Conditional Image Generation:** Generate new images conditioned on class labels, allowing for class-specific image synthesis.
- **Customizable Input:** Users can input a class label (0-9) to generate images corresponding to specific classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Extensive Training:** The model has been trained over multiple epochs to improve the quality of the generated images.

## **Dataset**

The project utilizes the **CIFAR-10** dataset, which is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The 10 classes include:

- **0:** Airplane
- **1:** Automobile
- **2:** Bird
- **3:** Cat
- **4:** Deer
- **5:** Dog
- **6:** Frog
- **7:** Horse
- **8:** Ship
- **9:** Truck

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Loading:**
   - The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using TensorFlow/Keras.
  
2. **Model Architecture:**
   - **Generator:** The generator model is designed to take a random noise vector and a class label as input, and output a 32x32 RGB image that resembles the class label.
   - **Discriminator:** The discriminator model is designed to distinguish between real images from the CIFAR-10 dataset and fake images generated by the generator. It also takes the class label as input to ensure the generated images match the specified class.

3. **Training Process:**
   - The generator and discriminator are trained together in an adversarial setup. The generator aims to produce realistic images, while the discriminator works to correctly classify real versus fake images. Over time, the generator improves and starts producing images that the discriminator struggles to classify as fake.

4. **Image Generation:**
   - After training, users can input a class label (0-9) to generate new images of the corresponding class. These images are entirely synthetic and are generated from random noise.

## **Project Structure**

- **`cgan_cifar10.py`:** The main Python script that includes the entire code for loading data, building the CGAN model, training, and generating images.
- **`models/`:** Directory containing saved models (optional, if you decide to save the trained models).
- **`outputs/`:** Directory where generated images are saved (optional).
- **`README.md`:** This file providing an overview and explanation of the project.

4. **Generate Images:**
   - After training, input a class label (0-9) when prompted to generate new images.


## **Challenges and Learnings**

- **Model Tuning:** One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the CGAN generated high-quality images. This involved fine-tuning the model architecture, hyperparameters, and the number of training epochs.
- **Conditional Generation:** Successfully implementing the conditional aspect of the GAN, ensuring that generated images matched the specified class labels.

## **Conclusion**

This project showcases the application of Conditional GANs in generating class-specific images. It serves as a practical example of how deep learning techniques can be leveraged to generate synthetic data, which can be useful in various real-world applications such as data augmentation and creative AI.

## **Future Work**

- **Model Improvement:** Explore deeper architectures and more sophisticated techniques like Progressive GANs for higher-quality image generation.
- **Expand to Other Datasets:** Apply the same technique to other datasets, such as CIFAR-100 or ImageNet, to test the model's scalability and versatility.
- **Deployment:** Consider deploying the model as a web application where users can generate images by selecting class labels through a user interface.
